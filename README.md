# Ligand-Design-for-Targeted-Drug-Discovery-Using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages machine learning to predict the bioactivity (IC50 values) of ligands, streamlining the drug discovery process. Through a user-friendly Streamlit app, researchers can input molecular data and receive real-time bioactivity predictions, helping identify promising drug candidates early and reducing development costs.
